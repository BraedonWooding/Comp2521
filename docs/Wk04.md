# Week 4 (BST + Revision)

## Height Difference (I don't really like this Question eh)

For each node in the tree print out the difference between the 2 subtrees.

And return the height of the tree.  To not make this question feel nice if it is an empty tree do nothing.

```c
int printHeightDiff(BSTree t) {
  // TODO:
}
```

## Can we detect if a tree is balanced?

?> What makes a balanced tree

NOTE: This question is a bit different from the tute because I just trimmed the fat from the question.

```c
int isHeightBalanced(BSTree t) {
  // TODO:
}
```

## Computing the width of a tree

- If the tree is empty it has width 0
- A tree with a single node has width of 3
- All other trees have width which is 3 more than the sum of the width of their children

```c
int BSTWidth(BSTree t) {
  // TODO:
}
```

## GDB + Valgrind :O

## Some more example Midsem questions

I probably won't do any of these during the tute just no time.  But we'll see :).

The midsem practice paper indicates that you need to be good at both linked lists and binary trees.

Please do both the practice paper and the practice exercises from [here](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP2521/19T3/resources/34197).

There are more questions [here](midsem_questions)
